There is a large setup violation of -7.417 ns between count_reg[14]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and count_num_reg[9]/S (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#60 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.421 ns between count_reg[14]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and count_num_reg[1]/S (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
